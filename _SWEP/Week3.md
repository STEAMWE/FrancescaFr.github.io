## Electronics:

This third week starts with an introduction to soldering, an electronic assembly technique that will be useful when students start assembling their drones.
This will segue into some basic electronic theory, to equip the students with the circuit building skills necessary to interpret and modify basic electromechanical systems. 

MOOCs (online courses) will also be introduced as an option for students who wish to pursue an academic focus or obtain specific program or skill training that the Opening Doors Staff cannot provide.

As the week progresses, students will be encouraged identify personal interests and explore the intersection of art and tech at those interest points, with the goal of finding a related maker project.
