 __Adam Green-Halley__ : Instructor for Airway Sciences at the Margaret Carter Skill Center, 
 a drone pilot with a focus on bringing drones to kids who generally don’t get the opportunity to have time with them. In my class we generally learn about things such as soldering, circuitry, drone building, training in drone simulators and flying drones. Even if you’re not very interested in drones, my classes are setup so that everyone will walk away having learned at least one skill they can take elsewhere.
