## Intro to Soldering

Soldering is a method of permanently joining electrical components together. Solder work can be found in any electronic device, from computers, to cell phones, to 3d printers.

### Soldering Project

To gain experience soldering through-hole electronic components onto a circuit board, students will assemble an FM Radio from base components.

** Disclaimer ** Traditional soldering uses a [tin/lead solder](/assets/PDF/SolderMSDS.pdf), which melts easily and makes strong connections, but is toxic to humans over repeated exposure. A less toxic, lead-free solder is now used in all consumer electronics in the US, however it is more difficult to use and requires a higher temperature soldering iron. In this class, we will primarily use leaded solder as it is the one that is easiest to learn with. If safety procedures are followed, risk of exposure is negligable. For students who wish, unleaded solder will be provided. 

#### Soldering Safety:
- Wear Safety Glasses (to protect from solder splatter, wire clippings)
- Create a clear workspace (Make sure soldering Iron will not come into contact with nearby objects, make sure it has a holder for when not in use)
- Perform soldering in range of Fume Extractor (protects you against inhaling solder rosin fumes)
- Do not touch soldering end (A soldering iron can remain hot after being turned off)
- Wear Gloves during soldering or wash hands immediately after (gloves strongly recommended to discourage hand-to-mouth contact).

## Online Courses ###

Online Courses are an affordable or free way for students all over the world to access knowledge and accreditation from world class universities such as MIT, Stanford, & Berkley as well as receive specialized trainings in programming and software packages.

### Setting up an online course account

As you will see, there are multiple providers of online courses, as the universities themselves do not host their own courses. You may need to create multiple accounts if you are taking multiple classes. When you do, make sure to use a consistant username and the same email address to help keep track of your login info.

Most importantly, if you are making many passwords **record your passwords and their account associations** somewhere you can find them (on the inside of your folder, for example). If you lose access to your account, you will lose all associated progress as well.
