- 2D Modeling with Adobe Illustrator
- Laser Cutting
- Circuits & Soldering

---------------------

## Laser Cutting 

Learn how to generate simple designs using Adobe Illustrator, 
then etch them out onto wood using a 60W CO2 ULS Laser Cutter.

 __Goal:__ Personalize your own Arduino Board Mount

Download the adobe template, apply designs to blank regions:
- Arduino Mounting Board [Template](/assets/images/boardtemp.)

## Soldering

Continue working on assembling FM radio

## Circuits

Work on integrating learned circuits / modifying example code
 - Try manipulating color fade in LEDs with Joystick
 - Drive multiple motors
 - Generate a tune with piezos
 
------------------------

## Project Discussion

Practice breaking down "big picture" issues into smaller, more managable problems that can be addressed by technological solutions.
