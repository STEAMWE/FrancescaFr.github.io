### Circuit 2: Using a Potentiometer
A Potentiometer is a variable resistor knob that can be used to adjust voltage output - this can be used to manually control the power supplied to an LED, or can be used to send signals back to your program.

### Circuit 3:Using a Photoresistor

A Photoresistor works similar to a potentiometer, but instead of being manually operated, its resistance is dependent upon how much light it is exposed to.

<a name="Soldering"></a>
## Intro to Soldering

Soldering is a method of joining electrical components together, like those you make on your bread board, but in a more permanent fashion. 

### Soldiering Guides

- [Sparkfun Guide to Soldering](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering)
- [Adafruit guite to Excelent Soldiering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/tools)
- [How to Solder- Video](https://youtu.be/QKbJxytERvg)


** Disclaimer ** Traditional soldering uses a [tin/lead solder](/assets/PDF/SolderMSDS.pdf), which melts easily and makes strong connections, but is toxic to humans over repeated exposure. A less toxic, lead-free solder is now used in all consumer electronics in the US, however it is more difficult to use and requires a higher temperature soldering iron. In this class, we will primarily use leaded soldering iron as it is the one that is easiest to learn with. If safety procedures are followed, risk of exposure is negligable. For students who wish, unleaded solder will be provided. 

#### Soldering Safety:
- Wear Safety Glasses (to protect from solder splatter, wire clippings)
- Create a clear workspace (Make sure soldering Iron will not come into contact with nearby objects, make sure it has a holder for when not in use)
- Perform soldering in range of Fume Extractor (protects you against inhaling solder rosin fumes)
- Do not touch soldering end (A soldering iron can remain hot after being turned off)
- Wear Gloves during soldering or wash hands immediately after (gloves strongly recommended to discourage hand-to-mouth contact).
