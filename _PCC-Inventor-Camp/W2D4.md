- 3D Modeling and Printing

-------------------

### What is 3D Printing?
3D Printing is an additive manufacturing technique where a material is applied in layers by a machine running a computer generated toolpath (unlike traditional machining, where stock is carved away at to produce a final geometry). This toolpath is derived from a 3D model, a geometry defined entirely on the computer by a user working in a modeling program.

There are many different types of 3D Printers, today we will be working with a common type called a Filament printer, which extrudes melted plastic as its additive material.


#### Some info in 3D Printers

### 3D Modeling Tutorials ###

The 3D Modeling program we will be using is called Fusion 360. It is cloud-based and free to students, so you can continue designing with the program once the course is over.

### Using Cura ###

After a 3D model is created, a toolpath specific to the user's 3D printer has to be generated, with the help of a slicing program which breaks the model into the individual print layers and builds out a path for the printer to take. We will be using Cura, another free program.

### 3D Model Sources ###

Many people generate and share 3D models that you can download, modify, and print on your 3D Printer.

[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) is a popular model sharing site.
